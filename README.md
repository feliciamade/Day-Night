# Night/Day Toggle

A beginner-friendly project showcasing how to implement a day/night mode toggle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project dynamically changes the background color and button icon based on the user's selection.
## What I learned
1. Assiting users using javascript: I used the alert javascript function to instruct users how to switch from light and dark mode.
